# OWASP SAMM
The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture.

SAMM is defined here: https://owaspsamm.org/

# What Is This?

This repository contains my own excel representation of the OWASP SAMM Model. 

An official excel version is available here: https://owaspsamm.org/resources/assessment-tools/

# Why?

I wanted to be able to use the SAMM model in a more flexible way and have the ability to visualize an organization's results / progress in a more dynamic way.

# How?

This is a fully self-contained excel sheet with no macros or external dependencies. It uses the built-in excel functionality to create a dynamic view of the SAMM model.
